\section{Conclusion}
Existing data-parallel frameworks require programmers and administrators
to make a tradeoff between responsiveness and utilization. In this paper we
have shown that this is not a fundamental tradeoff, and using tiny tasks one can both
achieve high utilization, and increased responsiveness. We believe data-parallel
jobs can be converted to use tiny tasks. We have presented the architecture for
a framework to realize this goal.
