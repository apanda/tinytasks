\section{Conclusion}
%We have described the great benefits of having tiny tasks and no tradeoff.
%We believe that as system designers and cluster architects, we should 
%try to build systems that allow this goal to be realized.
%We have described an initial architecture and some of the components
% that we think are requiredas the first steps twoards this goal.
Tiny tasks represent a simple design paradigm that mitigates stragglers and
allows increased utilization without sacrificing fairness or responsiveness.
We have presented an architecture that represents a first
step towards realizing tiny tasks.
%Our work highlights the importance of efforts to reduce overheads and provide
%increased scalability in cluster frameworks.
Given the benefits of using smaller tasks, we believe that the systems
community should focus on efforts to reduce overheads and provide
improved scalability in cluster frameworks.
