\section{Challenges}

\begin{myitemize}
  \item how small can we go ? Either use some measurements in terms of JVM
    launching overhead or network access overhead ?
  \item how to estimate resource usage ? we need to bin-pack lots of tiny tasks
    but don't know their sizes. also how to bin-pack in a distributed setting
    (sparrow-like) ?
  \item i.e., what if a task doesn't remain tiny ? how to prempt it efficiently ? 
  \item can we build a serving system out of this ? 
\end{myitemize}
