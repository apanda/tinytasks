\section{Challenges}

\subsection{How low can we go?}
Some back of envelope calculations here -- probably about 100ms. Maybe use
some of Josh's data for Spark.

\subsection{What about tasks that cannot be efficiently parallelized?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulated graph (based on FB traces) showing improvement as a function of
the percentage of tasks that can be parallelized
\item More extreme discussion of new framework that provides a distributed
scratch-space
\end{itemize}
