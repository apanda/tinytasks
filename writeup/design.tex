\section{Tiny Tasks}

\subsection{Design}

\begin{myitemize}
  \item API/Figure showing how tiny tasks look ? 
  \item Changes to the cluster scheduling arch. because of this.
  \item Example of how we take a Spark/Shark job and convert it to tiny tasks.
    Retro-fits into existing architecture seamlessly
  \item Some points about the data access we assume or build etc.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Simulation}

\begin{myitemize}
  \item How does data access pattern change as we change granularity ?
    \todo{Graph here}

  \item How does balance of tasks in a cluster (measured by queue length ?)
    change as we change granularity
    \todo{Graph here}
\end{myitemize}
