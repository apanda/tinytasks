\section{Architecting for Tiny Tasks}

\subsection{Design}

\begin{myitemize}
  \item API/Figure showing how tiny tasks look ? 
  \item Changes to the cluster scheduling arch. because of this.
  \item Example of how we take a Spark/Shark job and convert it to tiny tasks.
    Retro-fits into existing architecture seamlessly
  \item Some points about the data access we assume or build etc.
\end{myitemize}
