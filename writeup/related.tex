\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Process Migration} Include operating systems work on process
migration, as well as Ganesh's Amoeba paper. This work is most similar to
our approach. With tiny tasks, we are effectively architecting for pre-emption,
without needing to worry about moving large amounts of contexts between a
stopped and re-started job.

\paragraph{Skew Mitigation} Large body of over-engineered work on skew-
mitigation; most solutions fix only part of the problem and are highly
complex

\paragraph{Running Batch Workloads Alongside Interactive Workloads}
Google touts the fact that Omega/Borg schedule for both batch and interactive
workloads, but what they do is effecitively static partitioning (interactive
services have some portion of the cluster that they re-use to execute requests,
rather than scheduling a new job for each user request)! E.g., 
Dremel has a statically allocated part of the cluster.
