Current wisdom dictates that cluster computing frameworks should
use tasks with long task runtimes. However, long-running tasks result in
long wait-times for interactive, and user-facing jobs in mixed use clusters.
Furthermore, despite the use of elaborate skew mitigation
techniques, system designers continue to struggle with more evenly distributing the work required for a 
job across tasks. Recent improvements in distributed file systems, and scheduling
have eliminated many of the reasons why long task runtimes have been historically
preferred.
In this paper we argue for a move to tiny-tasks,
tasks with runtimes of a few $100$ milliseconds. Tiny tasks minimize
the necessity for pre-partitioning work across tasks, by enabling mechanisms for
dynamically
repartition the work for a job.  Furthermore,
for mixed workloads, the use of tiny tasks limits the time an
interactive job must wait before its tasks are run, allowing for  increased 
cluster utilization, and improving responsiveness, and job fairness.
We quantify these simulations, and show that smaller tasks can improve
response time by a factor of \fixme{5}. We also discuss some challenges 
faced in building a system using tiny tasks.
